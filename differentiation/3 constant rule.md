# 3️⃣ Constant Rule

## 🔹 Big Idea

If a function is just a constant number, its derivative is zero. The derivative of a constant is zero

If:

f(x) = c

(where c is a constant number)

Then:

d/dx (c) = 0

---

## 🧠 Why Is This True?

Derivative means:

How fast something is changing.

But a constant does not change.

Example:

f(x) = 5

No matter what x is:

x = 1 → f(x) = 5  
x = 100 → f(x) = 5  
x = -50 → f(x) = 5  

It never changes.

So the rate of change is:

0

## 🧠 Visual Intuition

The graph of:

f(x) = 5

is a horizontal line.

What is the slope of a horizontal line?

Slope = 0

Therefore:

Derivative = 0

---

## 🧠 Examples

### Example 1

d/dx (7) = 0

---

### Example 2

d/dx (100) = 0

---

### Example 3

d/dx (-3) = 0

---

### Example 4

d/dx (π) = 0

π is just a number (constant), so derivative is zero.

---

## 🧠 Important Note

Even large numbers are still constants.

d/dx (999999) = 0

Size does not matter.

If it does not depend on x → derivative is zero.

## 🤖 Why Constant Rule Matters in Deep Learning

In machine learning, loss functions often look like:

Loss = x² + 5

When taking derivative:

d/dx (x² + 5)

Derivative of x² = 2x  
Derivative of 5 = 0  

So:

Derivative = 2x

The constant disappears.

This simplifies gradient calculations.

## 🧩 Intuition Summary

Constant → No change  
No change → Zero slope  
Zero slope → Derivative = 0
